## üéØ **What is Algorithmic Trading?**

### **Definition**
Algorithmic trading (algo-trading) is a method where computer programs follow defined instructions to calculate price, quantity, timing, and other order characteristics automatically.

### **Market Size & Growth**
- **Current Market**: USD 15.76 billion (2023)
- **Projected Growth**: 10.6% annually (2024-2030)
- **Target Market**: USD 31.90 billion by 2030

## üìà **Evolution: Manual to Algorithmic Trading**

### **Historical Context**
- **Traditional Trading**: Started with Dutch East India Company (1602)
- **Manual Process**: Phone-based order execution, time-consuming, limited volume
- **Algorithmic Revolution**: Late 1980s-1990s with electronic exchanges
- **SEC Approval**: 1998 approval of electronic exchanges enabled HFT

### **Key Transformation**
- **Speed**: HFT executes trades 1,000x faster than humans
- **Automation**: Complete process from data gathering to order execution
- **Efficiency**: Eliminates human emotions and errors

## ‚ö° **Trading Frequencies**

### **1. High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**
- **Speed**: Large orders executed within seconds
- **Latency**: Ultra-low latency, millisecond-level trading
- **Profitability**: Highly profitable due to speed advantage

### **2. Medium-Frequency Trading (MFT)**
- **Timing**: Few minutes to a day
- **Latency**: Higher than HFT, lower than LFT

### **3. Low-Frequency Trading (LFT)**
- **Timing**: Day to couple of weeks
- **Latency**: Highest among the three types

## üéØ **Core Algorithmic Trading Strategies**

### **1. Market Making Strategies**
- **Purpose**: Increase market liquidity
- **Process**: Large institutions facilitate buy/sell orders
- **Function**: Display quotations, maintain inventory, ensure liquidity

### **2. Statistical Arbitrage Strategies**
- **Basis**: Mean reversion hypothesis
- **Example**: Pair trading with cointegrated stocks
- **Process**: Buy underperforming, sell outperforming when spread deviates

### **3. Momentum Strategies**
- **Principle**: Profit from market trends
- **Approach**: Buy high, sell higher
- **Risk**: Trends can reverse quickly
- **Requirement**: Proper risk management and timing

### **4. Mean Reversion Strategies**
- **Core Concept**: "What goes up must come down"
- **Application**: Short-term price fluctuations around historical averages
- **Use Case**: Technical indicators and value investing

### **5. Sentiment-Based Trading Strategies**
- **Data Sources**: Social media, news articles, financial reports
- **Analysis**: Bullish, bearish, or neutral sentiment
- **Execution**: Trades based on collective market mood

### **6. Machine Learning Trading Strategies**
